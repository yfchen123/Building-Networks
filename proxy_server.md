## Proxy Server Specifications

# What is a proxy server?
A web server refers to software and hardware which uses the Hypertext Transfer Protocol(HTTP) to serve files to clients as a response to their requests. On the other hand, a proxy server sits between a web server and a client. When a user sends an HTTP request, it goes to a proxy server first and the requested data is cached in a proxy server, and a proxy server returns to the client. If not, the request is forwarded to a server if necessary. 

# What is the function of a proxy server?
One of the most critical functions of a proxy server is caching. A proxy server caches previously requested files and returns them to a client directly when they are requested again. With the proxy server, the server and network load will be released.
